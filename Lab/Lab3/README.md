## Color
Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.

### HSL colors
HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.

->Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

->Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

->Lightness is also a percentage value, 0% is black, and 100% is white.
 
 #### syntax:
 hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
 hsl(100, 100%, 50%) 

 ### hsla()
 The hsla() functional notation expresses a given color according to its hue, saturation, and lightness components. An optional alpha component represents the color's transparency.

#### syntax:
hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
hsla(100, 100%, 50%, 1)
